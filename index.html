<p style="font-size:130%;">In today's society mental health is taken as a joke, a tiktok video, a way to get clout. We have watched many people put on a facade for social media  everyday when deep down they are hurt, sad, in pain and finding it hard to express how they genuinly feel.Our mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stress of life can work productiverly and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">Myth:Children dont experience mental health problems</p>
<img src= "https://www.amenclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blog-10-Signs-of-Mental-Health-Problems-in-Kids-You-Might-Miss.jpg" width="300px" style= "float:right;">
<p style="font-size:130%;">Fact:Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns.These mental health problems are often clinically disagnosable, and can be a product of the interaction of biological,psychological and social factors.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">Half of all mental health disorders show first signs before a person turns 14 years old, and three-quaters of mental health disorders begin before the age of 24 </p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">Unfortunately, only half of children and adolescents with diagnosable mental health problems recieve the treatment they need. Early mental health support can help a child before problems interfere with other developmental needs.</p>
<hr>

<p style="font-size:140%;">Myth:People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">Fact: The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent than anyone else. Most people with mental illness are not violent and only 3%-5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness. In fact,people with severe mental illness are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. You probably know someone with a mental health problem dont even realize it, because many people with mental health problems are highly active and productive members of our communities. </p>
