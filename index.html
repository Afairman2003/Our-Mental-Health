<p style="font-size:140%;">In today's society mental health is taken as a joke, a tiktok video, a way to get clout. We have watched many people put on a facade for social media  everyday when deep down they are hurt, sad, in pain and finding it hard to express how they genuinly feel.Our mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stress of life can work productiverly and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.</p>
