It is normal for fellings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations.Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being "depressed"</p>   

<p style="font-size:130%;">But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawl from usual activites. They are also different in important ways:</p>
<li style="font-size:130%;">In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about "joining" the deceased loved one. In major depression,thoughts are focused on ending one's life due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the pain of depression.</li>
<li style="font-size:130%;">In grief,painful waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased.In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.</li>
<li style="font-size:130%;">In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthless and self-loathing are common.</li>
